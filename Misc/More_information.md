# Solution
Through the challenge [Hix, Where is my friend???](Hix,_Where_is_my_friend???.md) we know that the place First was staying. 

It is Lits Camping in Sweden.

After some digging on the internet, we could found a map of Lits Camping on [this](https://www.jetcamp.com/en/sweden/lits-camping-stugby/) website.

We could locate cabin 901 and pin it on Google Maps.

Using Google Maps live view we could see the car in front of the cabin.
