It may looks like encoded message. But if looking at the end of file we could see a youtube link :D

Opening the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UmEGOYzEs8==), we see a video.

Watching the video, we could see some text pop up in the video.

I decided to download the video and use a video editing program to make it easier.

We got the flag 

```BKSEC{L1fee_cou13_be_4_DREAMNMMM!}```

But the flag isn't right, hmmmm. The video must have something else.

ANOTHER FLAG !!

```BKSEC{a_little_music_will_cheer_up_your_day:D}```

IT'S STILL WRONG !!

At the last frame we could barely see a link !

```https://hackmd.io/@exomuk/SJkiaysJa```

Open it, we could get the REAL flag !

```BKSEC{wh3n_life_h4rd_just_5mi1e:D}```
