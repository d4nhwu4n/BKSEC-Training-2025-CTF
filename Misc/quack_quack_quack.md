# Challenge description
There is a Duck around here... Why there is a Duck around here ?

File given: [note.txt](Challenge_files/quack/note.txt)
# Solution
Open the note.txt we got a ```base64``` encoded text. 

We could use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode the text.

And we got a bunch of Naknak words? 

After a search on google, it's actually a encryption method itself, called Nak Nak or Duckspeak

Use [this](https://www.dcode.fr/nak-nak-duckspeak) website to decode the message and we got.

```BKSEC{41_m4ng_c0n_v1t_va0_day???}```
